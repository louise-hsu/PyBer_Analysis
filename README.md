# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
Perform data analysis as a PyBer Data Analyst. We are trying to help PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services, and determine affordability in under-served neighborhoods. 

1. Convert CSV Files to Pandas DataFrames
2. Create a Bubble Chart for Ride-Sharing Data
3. Calculate Summary Statistics
4. Pie Chart: Percentage of Total Fares by City Type
5. Pie Chart: Percentage of Total Rides by City Type
6. Pie Chart: Percentage of Total Drivers by City Type
7. Line Chart: Tital Fare by City Type 

This Module taught me the following through Jupyter Notebook,Pandasm and MatPlotLib:
1. Inspect data
2. Merge data sets
3. Perform calculations
4. Create data series and data frames
5. Produce publication-quality figures using MatPlotLib 
6. Tell a visual story from the data using MatPlotLib

## Resource Folder
- city_data: Used for the Module 5 Skill Drills & Challenge. The Data shows each city, driver_count, and city type.
- PyBer_ride_data: This data was used to test and learn how to plot data.
- ride_data: Used for the Module 5 Skill Drills & Challenge. The Data shows each ride information - city, date, fare, ride_id
